Explanation of git branches, or how I use them:

dev:
	This branch is where all experimentation occurs.  Do NOT ever deploy
code in this branch.  It is not even expected to parse correctly.  This branch
may even be deleted and recreated on occasion.  You are warned.

testing:
	This branch is what I normally have deployed.  It is not gaurenteed to
be bug free or all code useful, but it should work.

master:
	This branch is for code from testing that is working as expected.  If
this branch is newer than testing, the diff should only be in comments and
documentation.  This branch should always be safe for production use.

tags:
	Most tags will be for my own information.  Release tags will be labeled
as Release N, with N being an alwasy increasing interger.
